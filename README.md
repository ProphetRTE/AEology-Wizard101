# Credit goes to [Slackaduts](https://github.com/Slackaduts) for their tool [Deimos](https://github.com/Slackaduts/Deimos-Wizard101) which I'm using as a base for this tool.

To run, be sure all your wiz clients are ordered correctly (p2 should be below and to the right of p1, etc), and all logged into the desired wizard. 
Run the AEology.exe by double clicking it. Pay attention to the blue text on the window that shows up, as it will tell you when the program is ready after lauching.

From here, it's very self explanatory. Look in AEology-config.ini to see what hotkeys are mapped. Refer to the discord server's reference channel for proper key names, they are case sensitive.

To remap keys, simply replace the key's name with the desired key in the config. Save your changes, then kill (with the kill hotkey) and relaunch the tool.

This tool gets updated when I have free time from college, and my personal project(s). Don't pester me for when updates are coming.

You can also close AEology by closing out the GUI, just never close out the CMD window.

<summary>Extra Info</summary>

The Deimos Base GUI also has a bot creator and flythrough creator. Information on these systems are in the bots/flythroughs channels of the Deimos discord server, or the wiki.

There's also more advanced features in the GUI that are difficult to explain in writing. Those are intended for more advanced users and/or script developers. No support will be provided on them.
Additionally, minimal support will be provided on auto questing and auto sigil. This is highly generalized code by design and it is impossible to fix every issue or every circumstance.
